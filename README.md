#### Which methods and algorithms have you applied and why?

#### What challenges did you experience?

#### How accurate is your solution?

We got an accuracy score of 0.0 for the test set, which means that the model did not correctly predict any of the municipalities of the test companies based on their income and number of employees. This would suggests that the model is not performing well, but when we observe the predictions made by our model, we can see that it works as intended. As shown when using seed=2, the two companies with the highest income are used as our test set. Therefore, our model predicts that these companies belong to Ballerup, which now has the highest income in the training set.

#### What else needs to be done for improvement of the accuracy of the solution?

To create a more accurate model in the future, we would need a much larger dataset to train it on.
